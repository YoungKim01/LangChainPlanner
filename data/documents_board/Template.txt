- How to create and circulate board paper

1) Based on the approved agenda(Usually approved agendas are performance, operation, profit + anything we want to add this time.), Secretary emails NEC. (assume NEC is same as board members for now). If you don't have it, ask. Normally fixed ones are: performance, operation, profit

2) NEC writes paper. 

3) Secretary circulates and distributes the paper to board members.
